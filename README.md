### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Anna. After facing unemployment for a few months, I finally decided that submitting applications is not enough and that it is time to showcase my skills in a more tangible way!

TL;DR: I am not a coder, but I am someone who appreciates code! Who doesn't in this day and age? Without, literally where would we be. Maybe it would be for the best? But I think not. I am a tech and especially an AI enthusiast who appreciates using Python and SQL to get shit done. 

Throughtout my varied, non-conventional career path thus far, I have experience in:
- applying AI methods to various use cases (computational linguistics, marketing operations/lead scoring)
- data analysis (customer support and business operations metrics, personal learning, academic coursework)
- querying data using SQL and SPARQL

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on ...
As I mentioned above, I am taking the next steps for my career and am trying to hone in on my data analysis and AI skills. My goal is to be able to collaborate on teams at forward-thinking AI companies, where I can bring my passion for developing ethical AI.
